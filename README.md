â€ƒ
Concept Summary:
Th idea is to help the students learn about different subjects which they can select from and then answer questions related to those subjects. It be similar to currently tutoring platforms such as Khan Academy

Target Audience:
School students who are struggling to understand different subjects at school.

Key Features:

1. Course Selection from pre-defined list, such as history, geography, and math
2. Different modes of answers such as creating images and diagrams related to the subject.
3. Generate quizzes and give feedback to the students

Technical Approach:
I will use a Low Code No Code platform such as Bubble.io. Also, I am planning to use OpenAI API as the main AI tool for interacting with the participants.

Expected Challenges:
Figuring out the requirements of the participants as there might be different subjects.

Submission Format:
1.	Word document that serves as user guide for ease of use.
2.	PowerPoint presentation highlighting the main features of the application.
Expected Outcome:
1.	Learning more about how to use OpenAI API in different projects 
2.	Learning how to use Low Code No Code in coding
Environment Setup
The application was built using Bubble as a Low Code/No Code platform and integrated with OpenAI API
Description of the Application

This app consists of two stages:
In the first stage, the student selects the subject and write his/her question below in the screen below and then clicks on Write answer

 

In the second stage, the app generates the answer and displays the result in the screen below
 
The user can then save the answer, this answer will be stored in Bubble Database
